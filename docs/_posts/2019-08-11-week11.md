**Targeted tools of the week**

* ColorTuner

* CamViz-ROS2-cpp

* VisualStates

**VisualStates**

Visualstates tool is currently supported in ROS-kinetic. Installed it by source in ROS-Melodic. Executed the tool and studied it's codebase.

**ColorTuner**

1. Migrated the required snippets to Python3 (Except ros1 part). ROS2 is supported only on python3. So, the tool can work with both versions. 

2. Extended the support for ROS2. 

3. Modified the interface to support both ROS1-ROS2. Pull_Request: [#PR6](https://github.com/JdeRobot/ColorTuner/pull/6)

Major challenges:


**CamViz-ROS2**

I was supposed to create a small script similar to the lines in code where the problem was coming, but there was some issue in identifying the exact line of segmentation fault.

I implemented multithreading in python with spin_once(), I will do it similarly in C++ Without using multiexecutor provided by ROS2 once.

| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------| --------------------- |      
| Debug Camviz      | Done | Week-1      |   [PR#32](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/pull/32)       |  PR merged for bug fixing        |                       |
| yaml support for ROS2 image drivers      | Done     |  Week-1       | [ros2-drivers](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/ros2-drivers)         | Fixed the error which was coming pre-gsoc period. These drivers were used in image tool later    |                    
| Migration to Dashing | Done      | Week-1          |    -      |   Installation and learning task                   |
| ROS1-ROS2 Interface | Done      |  Week-2         |  [cmakefile](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/dummyexample/CMakeLists.txt)        |    Getting right CMakelists.txt was the challenges of this task                 |
| Dummy library- 'Hello World!' | Done      |  Week-2         |    [dummy-library](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/dummyexample)      | Important to work on simplified problem before moving to complex so hello world! library helped in creating a basic tool whose complexity was increased later            |
| Image tool | Done      |   week-3  + week4      | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6v-G0QFUSg&feature=youtu.be) , [scripts](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/image-tool-scripts) [codes](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/camera-interface) |  Finished succesfully                    |
| Docker | Done      |  week-3 + weeek4         | [docker](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/Dockerfiles)         |  Course done on docker. Since a workaround was found no need of docker right now. Facing error in starting video drivers from docker    |

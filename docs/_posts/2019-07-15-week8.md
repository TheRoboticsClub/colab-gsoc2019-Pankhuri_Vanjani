**Goals of the week**

* Rosification of camViz tool

* Adding support of ROS2 in newer camViz tool

**Progress**

Basically I have to use previously build Subscriber camera-interface with a  C++ based GUI!!!

1. GTK 2.0 and GTK 3.0 mix up issue : old Status - Solved

This problem came again.

Current status: Unsolved

But sinnce it is a rutime problem so I am focusing on building tool ahead.

Merged ROS1 + ROS2 in camviz. No error in building it.

Working on refactoring the GUI part now.

Interesting solutions which I found for working ahead.

*  Replacement of ICEUTIL (time calculation) with Time in ROS http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Time

* Learning GTK + glade for building GUI tool

**CamViz tool**

Progress of First week:

First week of official coding period began with the interaction with mentors and setting goals for this week. This week focused on:
* Connect Camviz tool to ROS1 image driver
* Connect Camviz tool to ROS2 image driver

Currently JdeRobot has two tools camviz and camviz_py for this purpose. 
This week focused on understanding the code of camviz for modifying the tools to support ROS2.
A part of this work included fixing the issue discussed in [Issue#31](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/issues/31) and solved in [PR#32](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/pull/32).

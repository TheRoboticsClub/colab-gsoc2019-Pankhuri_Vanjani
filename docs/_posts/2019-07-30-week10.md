**Goals of the week**

* Solve Asynspinner issue in ROS2 to complete camviz

* Refactor carviz

**Progress 1**

**Carviz separated from base repository and rosified completely**

* Because of issue discussed in [absolute-path-jderobot-libraries](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/issues/35#issuecomment-511744843) I am leaving absolute path in all jderobot libraries that I am using.

N.B.***To use the current carviz-rosfied I have changed file "/opt/jderobot/include/jderobot/types/rgbd.h" , I have put absolute path of image.h here.


**Progress 2**

**Errors in installing Turtlebot3 packages for ROS2 Dashing**

Since I got some updates of Turtlebot3 I tried to install the packages as given in [ROBOTIS_e-manual](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/#ros2) . But I got errors and after checking more into it I found updates have been made for OpenCR, maybe have to wait a little more.

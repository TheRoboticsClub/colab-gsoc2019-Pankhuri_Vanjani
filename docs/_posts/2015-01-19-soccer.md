**From Hello World to Image display**


Last week I had worked on creating an interface for ROS1 and ROS2 and created a dummy library for publishing 'Hello World'. This  week I had to modify that interface to display image by uniting with image drivers.

Also it was discussed that we cannot switch the environment at runtime in c++ build currently so we should move to docker. Another task this week was to create different Dockerfiles.

**Wrapper for image display**

First I used my current interface for publishing the image. Initially I used the example given in ROS tutorials for displaying an image from a given path. This worked fine so next I moved to getting images from webcam. Gradually I moved individual subscriber nodes also to the interface.

When running this code from ROS1 I am getting this kind of image.

I looked into the issue of green background in ....{}  but could not solve it yet. I will look more into it.

ROS2 driver which was created before the GSoC period and improved in first week was used here. That was created in ROS2-Crystal but in this distro (Dashing), this code was giving errors due to changed conventions so firstly This code was corrected. This can be accessed in [ROS2-Image driver](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/ros2-drivers). 

With ROS2 the interface is working well. 

Complete video can be watched by clicking on the image.

**Steps to run this interface:**

mainpub.cpp: Publisher in this interface

mainsub.cpp: Subscriber in this interface

* ROS

  * Delete all previously buid and cache folders 
  
  * First Build the project: ``` colcon build --symlink-install \--cmake-args \ -Drosversion:string=1```
   
   string = 1 for for ROS1
  
  Run:
  
  * For Publishing image ``` ./build/camera-interface/mainpub 1 2  ```
  
   argv[1] = 1 For ROS1
   argv[2] = 2 (For selecting video device. In my Laptop device number 2 givs fine video stream.)
   
  * For Listening to  image ``` ./build/camera-interface/mainsub 1 /camserver/rgb  ```
  
   argv[1] = 1 For ROS1
   argv[2] = /camserver/rgb (For selecting the right topic to subscribe to)  
   
* ROS2

  * Delete all previously buid and cache folders 
  
  * First Build the project: ``` colcon build --symlink-install \--cmake-args \ -Drosversion:string=0```
   
   string = 0 for ROS2
  
  * Run ``` ./build/camera-interface/mainpub 2  ```
  
   argv[1] = 2 For ROS2
      
  * For Listening to  image ``` ./build/camera-interface/mainsub 2 /camserver/rgb  ```
  
   argv[1] = 2 For ROS2
   argv[2] = /camserver/rgb (For selecting the right topic to subscribe to)  
   

**Further improvement in architecture**

Further improvement should be made in this code architecture to bring uniformity in both ROS and ROS1. Current architecture in using a jdrc pointer variable and prefix. After correcting these two errors:

* Green background in images

* reading configurations from yaml file 

```
mainpub.cpp:(.text+0x453): undefined reference to `YAML::LoadFile(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)'
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

I might modify the code further.


**Progress in DOCKER FILES**

My task this week was to create dockerfiles for 3 different environments

* ROS1

* ROS2

* ROS1+ROS2

Since, I wasn't familiar with docker earlier I watched the suggested videos [Docker](https://youtu.be/YFl2mCHdv24) , [Docker-compose](https://youtu.be/Qw9zlE3t8Ko) and documentation to learn the basics.  

Now, I used the existing images to create different environments.

1. ROS Melodic

Dockerfile can be found in [ROS-Melodic dockerfile](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/Dockerfiles/ROS1%20docker)

![ros-melodic](../img/docker-melodic.png)

2. ROS Dashing
Dockerfile can be found in [ROS-Melodic dockerfile](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/Dockerfiles/ROS2%20docker)

3. ROS Melodic + ROS Dashing

  * Approach 1 : *multi-stage Dockerfile*
  
  Meged the content of both docker files. Basically 'multiple FROM' statements to get the existing images from ROS
  
  Result: Fail. It turned into the environment of the Distro which was there in the last 'FROM..' installation statements in Dockerfile.
  
  * Approach 2
  
  *Multi Containers with Docker-compose*

  * Approach 3   *Multi-Conatiners with Entrypoints*
   
   (post images and result)
   
  * Approach 4   *Download both ROS distros and keep separate Entrypoints*
   
   (Post images and result)
   
   I could not reach to final solution here.
   
   I think I am close to the right thing but discussing this issue with the mentors in this week's meeting would help in moving ahead with finishing it.

**DOCKER FILES**

* ROS1

(done.. post image here)

* ROS2

(done ...post image here)

* ROS1+ROS2

(using multiple FROM 

The multi-stage Dockerfile

Update: This is not working correctly. Only the distro which had installation lines in last is working.

Use correctly with docker-compose



**Wrapper for image display**

*from 'hello world' to image publisher subscriber*

Interface working well with ROS1 Image driver

(add image)

With ROS2:

Image is getting published..i.e. publisher working fine but Listener is not going ahead. (same driver created earlier)

It was working and created in Crystal, so worked well in it.

Giving some errors in dashing.

UPdate: Solved it now.

UPDATE: (16th June)

Wrapper - created for ROS2 Publisher

for ROS1- in progress

Earlier I was just reading and displaying an image from a given path in ROS1 whichi was fine, but now displaying from webcam. Image viewing screen is showing green background.  

**Target now:**

Include as wrapper instead for subscriber too inside interface

Another Idea: Use of ROS1-BRIDGE; We can publish image from ROS1 and read in ROS2 and ROS1 both and vice versa

Create Docker file for both ROS1 and ROS2.
Faced many errors as I was trying to include two base images. Now maybe I will download both ROS1 and ROS2 in my environment and create a docker from there

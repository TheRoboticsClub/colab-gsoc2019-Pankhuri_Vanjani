**Goals of the week**

* Teleoperation in ROS2 with C++

* Python sensor compatibility in ROS1 and ROS2 (Camera drivers)

* Bring Image viewer tool into our Jderobot CamViz 

**Teleoperation tool finished**

Links: 

**c++**

ROS1 : [Teleop_twist_keyboard_cpp](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/Teleoperation_tool/teleop_twist_keyboard_cpp)

ros2 : [ros2_teleop_keyboard_c++](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/tree/master/Teleoperation_tool/ros2_teleop_keyboard_c%2B%2B)

**Python**

ROS1 : [ros1-teleop.py](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/Teleoperation_tool/ros1-teleop.py)

ROS2 : [ros2-teleop.py](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/Teleoperation_tool/ros2-teleop.py)

Interface scripts:

1. [test.py](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/Teleoperation_tool/test.py)

2. [pyinterface-environment_set](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/Teleoperation_tool/pyinterface.py)

**Python sensor compatibility in ROS1 and ROS2 (Camera drivers)**

We are concerned by client side in our tools.

* ROS1 : Python image driver is working. Link to script: [ros1-image-subscriber](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/sensor-drivers_python/final.py)

* ROS2 : Python image driver code is correct but not displaying images after subscibing to a topic. It might be a driver issue. Script to run : [ros2-image-subscriber](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Pankhuri_Vanjani/blob/master/sensor-drivers_python/ros2sub.py)

**Let's move to official repository!!!! **

 .....A week full of struggles and installation stuff ......

Camviz tool : [**camViz-tool**](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/tree/master/camViz)

No compilation chain for viz repo yet. :( 

Error in building the camViz : Issue discussion [Issue#33](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/issues/33)

* Solved the Camviz after some struggle and whole discussion and problems on this issue can  be found in [#Issue33](https://github.com/JdeRobot/viz/issues/33)

* **Now working towards refactoring camViz**
 
1. Remove all ICE dependencies. Just keeping it compatible with ROS2

2. Make viz repository independent of Jderobot base repository,

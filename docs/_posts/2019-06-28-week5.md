* **Test the twist_keyboard in c++ for ROS1**
**(Done)**
    
  Make sure you hvae turtlebot drivers installed  by sudo apt-get install ```ros-melodic-turtlebot3*```

    ```source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash```

    ``` cd catkin_ws```

    ```catkin_make```

    ```cd src```

    ```git clone 'repo.git' ```

    ```cd..```

    ```catkin_make```

    ``` source devel/setup.bash```

    ```rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard_cpp teleop_twist_keyboard```

* **Connect the twist_keyboard to turtlebot and control it**
**(Done)**

    Steps:

    Terminal 1:

    ```source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash```

    ```roscore```

    Terminal 2:

    ```source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash```

    ```export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger ```

    ```roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch```

    Terminal 3:

    Follow instructions for *Test the twist_keyboard in c++ for ROS1*

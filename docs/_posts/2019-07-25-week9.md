**Goals of the week**

* Solve Asynspinner issue in ROS2 to complete camviz

* Refactor carviz

**Update:**

Turtlebot is not ready for dashing yet. Updates on [Update turtlebot3 to sync ROS2 Dashing](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/issues/426)

So, we don't have a mobile base robotics platform right now with both ROS1 And ROS2 support.

**Carviz current code architecture** 

To work into a big complicated tool it is better to get a simple flow of components. Here, I created one from present code.

Most complicated part is the comm library which has to be changed with ros-ros2 interface. To maintain simplicity I have created the  flow of all include and source files in comm library which will be used by carviz OR ANY OTHER APPLICATION IN JDEROBOT!!

**Rebuilding comm library for ROS1-ROS2**

* Last week I replaced ``` comm::Communicator* jdrc ``` for passing arguments from configuration file to ``` int argc, char** argv, std::string nodeName, std::string topic``` It was working for camviz as it was comparatively an easier tool but carviz is little complex so it would be better to keep the earlier version and create a neww class for ```Communicator* jdrc``` without using ICE and COMM library to support ROS and ROS2. 

**Comparison of yaml file in camviz vs carviz:**

Simpler yaml file in camviz faciliated easy usage of yaml file without the need of ``` comm::Communicator* jdrc ```. But it would create problems or will be a dirty implementation for bigger tool like carviz.
